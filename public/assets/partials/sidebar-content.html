            <p>
                I’m Luke, an Engineer with a B.A. in Computer Science from Cornell University's Ann S. Bowers School
                of Computing and Information Sciences. I'm based in Ithaca, NY.
                <br />
                <br />
                My work spans software development at
                Malaysia's National Oil & Gas Company, PETRONAS, as well as for non-profit organizations.
                <br />
                <br />
                Independently,
                I do Game Development, wearing hats as an organizer, developer and designer.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the software space, I'm interested in interactive and creative systems: from multiplayer backends,
                scalable tools,
                to user experiences that feel delightful. I enjoy building the infrastructure that powers collaboration,
                the tooling that
                empowers developers, and interactive experiences that delight users. My goal is to work at the
                intersections of
                systems, design and human experience, where engineering choices directly shape how people play, connect
                and create.
                <br />
                <br />
                In games, I'm deeply passionate about blending narrative depth with
                multiplayer experiences, inspired by my love of theater, improv and Dungeons & Dragons.
                At my core, I care a lot about people, whether its my users or my team.
