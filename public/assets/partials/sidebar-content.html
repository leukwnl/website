            <p>
                <br />
                I’m a Computer Science graduate from Cornell University with a minor in Performing & Media Arts, where I
                trained in theatre and storytelling. I’m interested in how systems, data, and technology can help people
                tell stories, create, and connect.
                <br />
                <br />
                Growing up in suburban Malaysia, I experienced how technology reshaped how communities were formed:
                games played and activities experienced from home, with friends across Southeast Asia. That experience
                made me curious about how we can design systems and experiences that bring people together rather than
                isolate them.
                <br />
                <br />
                I’ve previously worked on building knowledge base platforms at PETRONAS Digital, and continue to explore
                how data and interactivity can create better user experiences. In my own time, I take on roles as an
                organizer, developer, and designer creating small independent games.
                <br />
                <br />
                I'm especially curious about how technologies like AI, web interactivity, and AR/VR can enable new forms
                of work, play, and creation. I'm still learning the craft of design and interaction, but I enjoy
                exploring how these tools can shape meaningful user experiences.
                <br />
                <br />
                Outside of work, I run Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, tinker with tech, and write about game design and
                interactive systems.
