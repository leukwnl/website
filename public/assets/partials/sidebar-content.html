            <p>
                <br />
                My background spans software development at Malaysia’s national energy company, PETRONAS, and nonprofit
                tech initiatives, alongside independent projects in game development where I’ve worn hats as an
                organizer, developer, and designer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Growing up in multi-ethnic, multicultural Malaysia gave me a front-row seat to how technology reshapes
                culture. As society modernized and became more connected, I saw both opportunities and challenges.
                Games, in particular, became a bridge to bond with friends from very different backgrounds. That
                perspective, combined with my background in theater, improv, and storytelling, continues to shape how I
                see technology: not just as infrastructure, but as a cultural medium that connects people and
                communities.
                <br />
                <br />
                I’m especially interested in interactive and creative systems like multiplayer backends, scalable
                user/dev tools, and user experiences that feel alive. I enjoy building the infrastructure that supports
                collaboration and creation, and I aspire to work at the intersection of systems, design, and human
                experience, where engineering choices directly shape how people play, connect, and create.
                <br />
                <br />
                Outside of work, you'll find me playing Dungeons and Dragons, riding my bicycle, or tending to my
                plants.
