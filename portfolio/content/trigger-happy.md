# Case Study


>This case study is split up into 3 sections, diving deep into game design, UX design and engineering respectively. I recommend reading the whole thing, but the **Contents** on the right lets you jump wherever you like!


## Overview

Trigger Happy is a six-player, real-time, deck-based mobile card game, inspired by (link)Bang! and the schoolyard game, (link)War or 007. Players draw cards and take actions on a timer, to shoot and steal their way through a rapid-fire showdown in a feral 1920s Chicago. We won Audience Favorite at the Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC) Annual Showcase.

I was UX Lead & Programmer, and wore whatever hats were needed to ship, which included: music, storyboarding and technical writing. The game was built with nine other talented folks:

Amber Min, Caroline Hohner, Elaine Ran, Ireanne Cao, Jacob Seto, Linda Hu, Pedro Pontes García, Phoebe An and Shirley Li. 

Some of whom I've come to still make games with till this day.

## Goals

We had 12 weeks to showcase, and had that time to ship the mobile party game. I was particularly interested in pushing netcode and designing multiplayer gameplay, but the platform itself proved to be a challenge to work with. Limited screen real-estate, led to some unique and new opportunities that we'll talk about below. The target audience we chose were casual players, emphasizing the frictionless pick-up-and-play, and freshness over multiple sessions.

## Highlights

1. Card ecosystem & decks. I balanced resources and defined deck archetypes so players can express themselves without slowing the tempo.
2. Mobile UI. Designing intuitive, immersive, touch-first interfaces that respect information hierarchy under tight space.
3. Engineering. A haptics library for Cornell’s in-house engine (CUGL) and a lightweight networking controller to support real-time play.
